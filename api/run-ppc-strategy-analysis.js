/**
 * api/run-ppc-strategy-analysis.js
 * POST /api/run-ppc-strategy-analysis
 * Body: { brand: "evolis" }
 *
 * Added 2026-08-07 per Jaclyn. Manually triggered from a new "Run PPC
 * Analysis" button on the Insights Log page — same manual-not-cron
 * philosophy as run-analysis.js and run-listing-audit.js (Jaclyn wants
 * these trackable by who ran them and when, not silently automated).
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS SEPARATELY FROM run-analysis.js's EXISTING
 * ppc.strategy_by_sku: run-analysis.js already computes a per-SKU
 * snapshot (sessions/units/revenue/conversion/top_keywords) and has
 * Claude write 2-4 recommended_bullets + suggested_exact_match_targets
 * into the ppc_json column of SHEET_INSIGHTS's per-brand tab. That
 * genuinely overlaps with part of this. But the hardcoded dashboard
 * cards this is meant to replace (see Jaclyn's screenshots, 2026-08-07)
 * have THREE things the existing ppc_json approach doesn't:
 *   1. A top-line status badge per product ("TRAFFIC — Conv is strong",
 *      "LISTING FIX BEFORE SCALING PPC", "IMMEDIATE — 0 sessions, 0
 *      units") — not computed anywhere currently.
 *   2. "Wasted spend" flags on specific suggested keyword targets —
 *      not computed anywhere currently.
 *   3. A storage shape Jaclyn explicitly wants changed: ONE ROW PER
 *      PRODUCT on a NEW shared tab (SHEET_INSIGHTS gid=1053885538,
 *      currently blank) that EVERY BRAND writes to, keyed by SKU/ASIN —
 *      not a brand-scoped tab with one JSON blob per week nested
 *      inside a single log row. That's a real architecture change, not
 *      just an additive field, so it gets its own endpoint and its own
 *      write path rather than bolting further complexity onto
 *      run-analysis.js's existing per-brand-tab logic.
 *
 * Same "code computes facts, Claude only writes prose against them"
 * philosophy as run-analysis.js throughout: sessions/units/revenue/
 * conversion_pct, the status badge, and wasted-spend terms are ALL
 * computed deterministically in code below. Claude's only job is to
 * write 2-4 tactical recommendation bullets (with a priority per
 * bullet) and pick which of a SKU's own top keywords are worth calling
 * out as suggested exact-match targets — it does not invent numbers,
 * classify status, or decide what counts as wasted spend.
 *
 * ADDED 2026-08-07 per Jaclyn: this cron, run-analysis.js, and
 * run-listing-audit.js were operating as three independent silos —
 * PPC strategy had no idea the listing had a known, already-flagged
 * compliance violation; a fresh listing audit had no idea PPC already
 * concluded a product needs a listing fix before scaling spend. Fixed
 * by pulling in BOTH other analyses' latest output as extra read-only
 * context per SKU:
 *   - SHEET_INSIGHTS (évolis tab, gid=1069613491) — run-analysis.js's
 *     own most recent weekly row. Its ppc_json.strategy_by_sku is
 *     surfaced per SKU as "what the other weekly analysis already
 *     concluded" (a second opinion, not a duplicate — this cron's own
 *     status_badge/wasted_spend/inventory checks aren't in that older
 *     analysis at all), and its listing_json.implementation_status is
 *     surfaced too (whether a PRIOR listing recommendation actually got
 *     implemented, per that file's own already-built comparison logic).
 *   - SHEET_LISTING_AUDIT (évolis tab, gid=2075287627) — the latest
 *     audit row per SKU. Its *_notes fields (compliance findings, not
 *     the full rewrite text — kept short deliberately, see GAP #5) are
 *     surfaced so Claude can factor in a REAL, currently-open listing
 *     issue when writing PPC recommendations, the same way it already
 *     factors in this cron's own status_badge.
 * See buildCrossAnalysisContext() below. Same instruction pattern as
 * the OOS check further down: Claude is told explicitly what to do
 * with this context (don't recommend scaling PPC into a listing with
 * an unresolved violation), not just handed the data and left to guess
 * how much weight to give it.
 *
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * REAL GAPS BELOW — FLAGGED, NOT SILENTLY GUESSED:
 *
 *   1. RESOLVED 2026-08-07: the guessed tab name ("ppc_strategy") turned
 *      out not to match gid=1053885538 (Jaclyn's originally-intended
 *      blank tab) — since Google's write API needs a name not a gid,
 *      writing to the guessed name created a NEW tab instead, with its
 *      own new gid (1273080018). Confirmed working and Jaclyn opted to
 *      just keep this new tab as the real one going forward rather than
 *      correct it — PPC_STRATEGY_TAB_NAME below is now the confirmed,
 *      real destination.
 *
 *   1b. NEW 2026-08-07 per Jaclyn: PPC should never be recommended on an
 *      out-of-stock product. Added an inventory check against
 *      SHEET_NEWDERM_INVENTORY (évolis tab gid=2074324776).
 *
 *      FULLY RESOLVED 2026-08-10 — Jaclyn provided both config/sheets.js
 *      and a screenshot of the real sheet. Confirmed: config key is
 *      `newdermInventory`; the sheet genuinely has the 2-row merged
 *      header sheets.js's own comment described (row 1 = merged section
 *      titles like "Amazon Warehouse USA - FBA" / "Medaltus Warehouse -
 *      SF", blank outside each merge's leftmost cell; row 2 = the real
 *      column names; data starts row 3); readRows() (confirmed from its
 *      actual source) always treats row 1 as headers with no per-sheet
 *      override, so it was reading row 2's real headers as if they were
 *      the first data row, and every value came back undefined —
 *      exactly why is_oos read false for every single SKU. Fixed by
 *      fetchNewdermInventoryRows() below, which fetches this one sheet's
 *      raw range directly (A2:AE, skipping row 1 entirely) instead of
 *      going through readRows(). Also confirmed: this sheet has NO ASIN
 *      column at all, only `sku` — buildSkuSnapshots()'s existing
 *      ASIN-then-SKU fallback already handles this correctly since
 *      oosMaps.byAsin is simply always empty for this sheet, no code
 *      change needed there. FBA_QTY_CANDIDATES/WAREHOUSE_SF_QTY_
 *      CANDIDATES below now lead with `core_available_fba`/
 *      `core_available_sf` — this sheet reconciles marketplace-reported
 *      quantities against Cin7 Core's own tracked quantities (per
 *      sheets.js: "marketplace vs Cin7 Core by location"), and the
 *      core_available_* columns are Cin7's reconciled true-available
 *      figure, which is presumably the whole reason this reconciliation
 *      sheet exists rather than reading Amazon's/Walmart's own reported
 *      numbers directly. The raw marketplace-reported columns
 *      (amazon_fulfillable_quantity, amazon_seller_fulfilled_quantity)
 *      are kept as fallback candidates in case core_available_* is ever
 *      blank for a row Cin7 hasn't reconciled yet.
 *
 *   2. UPDATED 2026-08-08 per Jaclyn: this tab is meant to hold HISTORY,
 *      not just current state — "if I run this a week from now, I want
 *      it to add new rows," with same-day re-runs overwriting only that
 *      day's row per SKU. writeSkuStrategyRows() below was originally
 *      wrong here (stripped ALL of a brand's rows on every run
 *      regardless of date, silently deleting prior history) — fixed to
 *      only strip rows matching this brand AND today's exact date.
 *
 *      REVISITED 2026-08-10 — Jaclyn provided the real
 *      config/_sheets_client.js. Confirmed: replaceRows(sheetId,
 *      tabName, headers, rows, token) clears A2:ZZ then writes `rows`
 *      starting at A2 — it NEVER touches row 1, and its `headers`
 *      parameter is dead code, never referenced in the function body.
 *      ensureTab() only writes row 1 when the tab doesn't exist yet; on
 *      an existing tab it just logs a loud warning on header mismatch
 *      and deliberately does not auto-correct (its own comment: sheets
 *      "get hand-edited sometimes... blind auto-correction could clobber
 *      that"). Practical result confirmed from a live incident: this
 *      tab's header row got stuck at an old 14-column schema after
 *      is_oos was added as a 15th column, and neither ensureTab() nor
 *      replaceRows() will ever fix that automatically — it needs a
 *      one-time manual correction of row 1 (already done as of
 *      2026-08-10). The code in writeSkuStrategyRows() below does NOT
 *      attempt to write or correct row 1 itself, on purpose — a prior
 *      attempt to do so by prepending the header into the `rows` array
 *      wrote it as a literal data row at A2 instead (since that's where
 *      rows always start), stacking a duplicate-looking row instead of
 *      fixing anything. If this schema changes again, row 1 needs
 *      another manual fix — that's a real, known limitation of this
 *      tab's write path, not an oversight.
 *
 *   3. WASTED-SPEND JOIN KEY IS GUESSED. aggregatePpcByTerm() (copied
 *      from run-analysis.js) doesn't scope by ASIN/SKU at all — it just
 *      sums by search term across the whole sheet. buildWastedSpend()
 *      below tries to re-scope it per-ASIN by checking for an `asin` or
 *      `sku` field on each PPC row (ASIN tried first). If neither field
 *      exists on the real advertising sheet, wasted_spend_terms will
 *      come back empty for every SKU rather than wrong — check the
 *      console warning this logs if that happens.
 *
 *   4. STATUS BADGE THRESHOLDS ARE A FIRST-PASS GUESS, calibrated
 *      against exactly the 3 screenshot examples Jaclyn gave (Reverse:
 *      122 sessions/22.95% conv → "TRAFFIC"; Promote: 1,125 sessions/
 *      3.2% conv → "LISTING FIX"; Prevent: 15 sessions/0 units →
 *      "IMMEDIATE"). See computeStatusBadge() below for the exact
 *      numbers — these are almost certainly worth tuning once this runs
 *      against the full catalog and Jaclyn can eyeball whether the
 *      cutoffs feel right on products outside those 3 examples.
 *
 *   5. CROSS-ANALYSIS FIELD NAMES — mostly confirmed, one guess. SHEET_
 *      INSIGHTS's date/organic_json/ppc_json/listing_json/summary/
 *      uploaded_at columns and listing_json.implementation_status are
 *      confirmed directly from run-analysis.js's own header comment and
 *      code (same file this endpoint is meant to collaborate with).
 *      SHEET_LISTING_AUDIT's `sku` and `audited_at` fields are confirmed
 *      from the dashboard's own already-working loadAuditResultsFromSheet()
 *      code. The one real guess: the exact *_notes field names
 *      (title_notes/ih_notes/bullets_notes/desc_notes/backend_notes) —
 *      these match what showed up in a screenshot of one real audit
 *      result earlier in this project, but weren't re-confirmed against
 *      a fresh fetch here. buildCrossAnalysisContext() logs the real
 *      keys it finds on the first row of each sheet every run, so a
 *      naming drift is a quick console check rather than a silent gap.

// Not a data problem — a single-call-does-everything design problem.
// Fixed by splitting into small batches run in PARALLEL: each batch only
// has to generate output for a few SKUs, so each individual call
// finishes fast, and the total wall-clock time is bounded by the
// slowest single batch rather than the sum of all of them. A failed or

"Do not scale PPC on Vitamin C Serum until Bullet 1 is rewritten. Spending more money to send 900+ monthly visitors to a listing that converts at 2.8% is burning budget."
"Spicule Serum had 12 sessions and 0 units last month. This product has no organic rank signal on any keyword. Zero revenue means zero organic velocity."

Return ONLY this JSON structure:
{"<SKU>":{"headline":"string","recommended_bullets":[{"priority":"HIGH|MED|LOW","text":"string"}],"suggested_exact_match_targets":["string"]}}

Rules:
- One entry per SKU from the snapshot below, keyed EXACTLY by SKU. Do not add or omit SKUs.
- IF a SKU's is_oos is true: do NOT recommend launching, scaling, or bidding on PPC for it under any circumstances — status_badge already says OUT OF STOCK. headline and every bullet should instead say plainly that this product is out of stock and PPC spend should stay paused until it's back in stock. suggested_exact_match_targets should be an empty list for an out-of-stock SKU — there is nothing to target while it can't be sold.
- IF a SKU's listing_audit_notes is non-empty: that is a REAL, currently-open compliance/quality finding from this week's separate listing audit. Treat it the same weight as is_oos and status_badge — if there's an unresolved listing issue, at least one HIGH priority bullet should say to fix that specific issue before or alongside scaling PPC, referencing what the note actually says (do not paraphrase it into something vaguer).
- IF a SKU's prior_weekly_analysis_ppc_notes is non-empty: that is what last week's separate brand analysis already concluded about this SKU's PPC strategy. Use it as a second opinion, not a script to copy — if this run's own numbers (sessions/conversion/is_oos/audit notes) tell a different story than that prior note, trust THIS run's real numbers and say so, rather than silently repeating a stale conclusion.
- IF a SKU's listing_implementation_status is present: it says whether a PREVIOUSLY recommended listing fix has actually gone live yet. If it shows the fix is still NOT implemented, do not write a bullet assuming the fix already happened.
- headline: one sentence, matches the tone/urgency of that SKU's status_badge (already computed — do not contradict it).
- recommended_bullets: 2-4 bullets, HIGH priority first, each one tactical sentence referencing REAL numbers from that SKU's own snapshot only (sessions, conversion_pct, revenue, or a keyword's vol_mo/aba_pct/cpc). Do not invent numbers. Do not compare one SKU against another SKU.
- suggested_exact_match_targets: 3-7 keyword strings pulled ONLY from that SKU's own top_keywords list — do not invent keywords. (Empty for an out-of-stock SKU — see above.)
- Do not mention wasted_spend_terms in prose — that's rendered separately by the dashboard from the same data you're seeing here, no need to restate it.
- No apostrophes in string values — use "does not" not "doesn't".
- NEVER use a double-quote character anywhere inside a string value, including around keyword phrases — your entire response must itself be valid JSON, and an un-escaped double quote inside a JSON string breaks the whole response. Use single quotes for any quoted phrase instead (e.g. write 'snail mucin serum', never "snail mucin serum").
- Keep all string values under 200 characters.

  // cause of headline/bullets/targets landing under the wrong column
  // labels. That diagnosis was correct. My fix was not: I assumed
  // replaceRows()'s separate `headers` argument doesn't touch row 1, so
  // I additionally prepended PPC_STRATEGY_HEADERS as the first element
  // of the `rows` array itself to force it. Confirmed wrong from a live
  // screenshot after deploying: it produced THREE different stacked
  // header-looking rows at the top of the sheet before any real data,
  // meaning replaceRows() DOES write its own header row from the
  // `headers` argument — and, more importantly, does NOT clear
  // pre-existing rows the way "replace" implies. Every run was adding
  // on top of what was already there, not overwriting it.
  //
  // I do not have visibility into config/_sheets_client.js to know
  // replaceRows()'s exact real behavior, and two guesses in a row have
  // both been wrong — a third guess isn't the right move here. The
  // certain, verifiable fix: manually delete ALL rows in the ppc_strategy
  // tab (including the header row) so it's genuinely blank, then run
  // this endpoint once. ensureTab() will then write a single correct
  // 15-column header from scratch (it only fires on a truly blank tab,
  // which is exactly the condition this needs), and every column will
  // line up with its label from that point on. This code below is
  // reverted to its pre-2026-08-07 form — no header-prepending — since
  // that's the version that never itself caused stacking; the header
  // mismatch it still won't fix is the OLD stale header, which a manual
  // clear resolves directly instead of more code trying to out-guess an
  // unknown API.
